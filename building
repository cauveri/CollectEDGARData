To build this application you need the following:
- compiler which supports c++11.  I used gcc 4.8.2.  Clang 3.4 should work too.
- Boost libraries (www.boost.org).  I used Boost 1.55
- Poco libraries (pocoproject.org).  I used 1.4.6.2
- my app_framework project which needs to be installed in a directory which is a peer to this directory.

Since I have multiple versions of compilers and boost on my system and they are located in
non-standard places, there are some makefile variables which need to be set to point to
the versions being used.

BOOSTDIR needs to point to the root of your Boost installation.  A likely value is /usr where the Boost 
libraries are in /usr/lib and includes are in /usr/include/boost

GCCDIR needs to point to the root of your gcc installation. Again, a likly valuu is /usr where
g++ is in /usr/bin and headers are in /usr/include.

To build a release version do:
 make CFG=Release

To build a debug version do:
 make  (this defaults CFG to Debug)
